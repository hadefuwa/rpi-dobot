The new PWA-based Raspberry Pi gateway will act as a universal communication bridge within the Smart Factory platform, connecting the Siemens S7-1200 PLC, the Dobot Magician robotic arm, and any connected operator interfaces. It replaces the need for a dedicated Windows PC or closed-loop PLC link by providing a lightweight, headless control server that manages all communication locally on the factory network. The Pi runs a Node.js service that simultaneously communicates with the Dobot through either USB or TCP (Port 29999) and with the Siemens PLC over Ethernet using the Snap7 protocol. This allows real-time command, status, and position data to flow between the robot cell and the PLC logic that coordinates the conveyors, sensors, and pneumatic modules of the Smart Factory.

Through the web-based PWA interface, instructors and students can monitor and control the entire cell from any device on the LAN — whether that is the integrated touchscreen on the Smart Factory base or an external tablet. The interface mirrors live data from the PLC and the robot, showing joint positions, conveyor states, and reject-mechanism feedback in real time via WebSockets. Because it runs in a browser, no special software installation is required, and the same dashboard can be accessed simultaneously by multiple users for observation or collaborative exercises.

In operation, the gateway will allow the S7-1200 to trigger Dobot routines such as pick-and-place or inspection tasks as part of the standard Smart Factory sequence. When the PLC sets a control bit or writes a value to a data block, the Pi interprets that command and issues the corresponding Dobot API instruction. The robot’s pose, motion status, and error flags are then read back by the Pi and written to PLC data words for use in the overall process logic or for display on the Siemens HMI. This closed data loop ensures that the Dobot behaves as a fully integrated workstation within the Smart Factory, rather than as an isolated peripheral.

Beyond basic control, the gateway architecture enables future extensions such as data logging, KPI tracking, and Industry 4.0 analytics. Because all communication passes through the Node.js server, metrics like cycle time, part counts, and energy use can be logged to a local database or published via MQTT to higher-level dashboards. The same foundation could later support additional robots, vision systems, or IO-Link sensors, turning the Smart Factory into a modular, network-oriented training environment that reflects real industrial integration practices.
